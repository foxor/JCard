JCard
=====

A framework for the creation of web-based card and board games


Project Organization
====================

The project consists of 2 main parts: a Java backend, and a javascript frontend.


Frontend
========

The frontend should be as lightweight as possible, dealing primarily with clicking and dragging components created by the backend.

There is one extra responsibility for the frontend: submitting a game.  To alley copyright concerns and encourage hacking, all game rules, and content will be stored in a csv presented by the user at the beginning of the game.

Open questions: how does someone create a deck, and then use it.  How are sessions persisted?
